             <h4>Dear Son,</h4>
            <p>
                I never finalised a name before you were born. A part of me was superstitious, while the other part never found any name that sounded perfect for my baby.

                When you were born and I chanced upon this name, it immediately felt right. It signifies star. You have been and will always remain the star of our lives, the centre of our universe.

                It is hard to remember how life was without you. But no matter what, it wasn’t this beautiful!

                I cannot believe you are two already! Two years is a long time and then not really. It is hard to remember how life was without you. But no matter what, it wasn’t this beautiful!

                This letter is not about the milestones you have crossed, because how does it matter whether you started walking at 1 or 1.5 years. This letter is a celebration of our life together in the last two years.</p>
